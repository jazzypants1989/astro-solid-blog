## **Introduction**

<br />

We have full client-side routing, but we're not doing much with it yet. We could define all of our products in an object in the index.html. Perhaps that would be truer to the spirit of doing this all in one file, but that's not how real web sites work.

<br />

So, we will be building a fake database in our public folder that defines a few products and their details. We will then use the Web Fetch API to get the data from the database and display it on the page. This will simply be a JSON file, but it could be a database, or a REST API, or anything else that returns JSON. The principle is the same.

<br />

Before we define each of these things, first let's finish creating our view templates so that we actually have pages ready to fill with data.

<br />

## **View Templates**

<br />

In our last chapter, we created a `Routes` configuration object that defined four static routes, Home, About, Products, and Cart. However, each view template contained some repetitive code used to manipulate the DOM. And, we will want to link between the products page to a new page that displays the details of a single product. While doing this, we will want to run our linkFinder function to make sure that our interal links will work while not placing unnecessary event listeners on the page.

<br />

To solve both of these problems at once, let's separate our rendering logic into a separate function called `render` that takes a template as an argument and adds whatever links are needed on the page. This function will return a string that we can then insert into the DOM. The `linkFinder` function included is the one we employed in the previous chapter.

<br />

<div
  style={{
    maxWidth: "100%",
    overflow: "auto",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    fontSize: "1.3rem",
  }}
>
  
  ```js
    function render(component) {
    console.log(`The render function just ran with ${component}`)
    // Since we only have one dynamic element on the page and very content in common between pages,
    main.innerHTML = component
    // We can just replace the entire innerHTML of the main element
    linkFinder()
    // And then run the linkFinder function to add event listeners to our links
  }
  ```

</div>

<br />

Next, let's make the actual view templates. First, we create two static view templates that are simple text with one photo. We will call them `home` and `about`. Then, we will create a product component that we will share between a `products` template to display all of our products and a `product` template to display individual products. Finally, we will create a 404 page with a different message for static and dynamic routes. The cart template will be updated in the next chapter.

<br />

<div
  style={{
    maxWidth: "100%",
    overflow: "auto",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    fontSize: "1.3rem",
  }}
>
  
  ```js
    // Almost all of our final components
      const Home = () => {
        console.log("Home component is rendering")
        document.title = "Home" // Set the page title
        render(`
        <p>This is a totally real shop! See! That's a picture! Of a shop! Totally
      open.</p>
      <img src="/diana.avif" alt="Check us out" />
        `)
      } // Hmm, this looks familiar.

      const About = () => {
        console.log("About component is rendering")
        document.title = "About"
        render(`
        <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This is a totally real shop that sells totally real products. It's not a
        demonstration of how client-side routing works. Noo! It's just a
        shop.
      </p>
        `)
      } // It's a functional component!

      const ProductComponent = (product) => {
        console.log("A product is rendering")
        return `
        <div class="product">
          <a href=/product/${product.id} class="Link">
            <img src="${product.image}" alt="${product.name}" />
          <h2>${product.name}</h2>
          </a>
          <p>${product.description}</p>
          <p>$${product.price}</p>
          <button class="add-to-cart" id="${product.id}">Add to cart</button>
        </div>
        `
      } // Oh look, we're passing props now.

      const ProductsPage = async () => {
        console.log("Products component is rendering")
        document.title = "Products"
        const products = await getProducts() // Get the products
        const productsHTML = Object.values(products)
          .map((product) => ProductComponent(product))
          .join("") // Map over the products and render each one
        render(productsHTML) // Render the products
        buttonFinderAdd()
      }

      const ProductPage = async (id) => {
        console.log(
          `The ProductPage component is rendering product with ID: ${id}`
        )
        await getProducts() // Get the products
        const product = products.find((product) => product.id === Number(id)) // Find the product that matches the id
        if (!product) {
          return Nope(id)
        }
        document.title = product.name // Set the page title to the product name
        search.value = product.name // Set the search input value to the product name
        product ? render(ProductComponent(product)) : Nope(id) // If we find a product, render it. If not, render the 404 page.
        buttonFinderAdd()
      }

      const Nope = (id) => {
        console.log(`404 Component just rendered on ${path}.`)
        console.log(`ID detected: ${!!id}`) // The double bang is just a fancy way of converting the id to a boolean. If there's an id, it'll be true. If there isn't, it'll be false.
        if (id) {
          render(
            `<h1>404</h1><h2>Sorry buddy, but I don't think we have a product with id #${id}!</h2>`
          )
        } else {
          render(`<div>
          <h1>404</h1>
          <h2>Huh, you're at ${path}, but you really shouldn't be</h2>
        </div>`)
        }
      } // Only on v1 of this project, and I already have 2 404 pages... I think that's a good sign?

```

</div>

<br />

Whew! That was a lot! But, that is almost all of the mark-up for our entire app out of the way. But, wait... Where are we getting these products from? Oh yeah! We need to make a database!

<br />

## **Our Database**

<br />

We will be using a file called db.json in our public folder. This will be a JSON file that contains an array of two whole products. Each product has an id, name, price, quantity, description, and image. We will be using the Web Fetch API to get this data from the file and display it on the page.

<br />

<div
style={{
  maxWidth: "100%",
  overflow: "auto",
  borderRadius: "5px",
  fontSize: "1.3rem",
}}
>

```json
{
"products": [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Goofy board game",
    "price": 100,
    "quantity": 1,
    "description": "The best Disney movie now has a board game! Look at how evil they made the singer look for some reason.",
    "image": "/goofy.webp"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Creepy toy",
    "price": 200,
    "quantity": 2,
    "description": "This toy is so creepy, it will give you nightmares.",
    "image": "/toy.webp"
  }
]
}
```

</div>

<br />

## **Web Fetch API**

<br />

The Web Fetch API is a way to get data from a server. It is a modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest, so it is a promise-based API. That just means that it returns a promise that resolves to a response object. This response object contains the data that we want.

<br />

This will result in asynchronous code which was very hard to do right with JavaScript for a long time. Now, it's easy. We can simply use the async/await syntax to make it look synchronous. We will be using this to get our data from the db.json file.

<br />

We're going to reuse this code in a few places, so we will first create an empty object called products to cache the data so we can take advantage of our stateful application. We don't have to call the server for every page like we would if we were creating a traditional server-side rendered application. This helps us avoid unnecessarily taxing the server, and we don't expect our data to change very often so this won't lead to any problems.

<br />

We will then create a function called db that returns a fetch to our pretend database. Next, we make another function called getProducts that will return the products if they are already in the products object. If they aren't, it proceeds to call the db function and update our empty products object with the data from the db.json file.

<br />

<div
  style={{
    maxWidth: "100%",
    overflow: "auto",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    fontSize: "1.3rem",
  }}
>
  
  ```js

let products = {}; // An initial empty object for us to cache our products in

    // "Database" of products
      const db = async () => {
        // This has to be async because we're using fetch
        const response = await fetch("/db.json") // Get the db.json file
        const data = await response.json() // Parse the JSON
        console.log("Initial DB fetch")
        return data // Return the data
      }

      const getProducts = async () => {
        // This has to be async because we're using fetch
        if (products.length > 0) {
          console.log("Products have been cached")
          return products // If we've already fetched the products, return them
        }
        console.log("Products are being fetched")
        const data = await db() // Get the data from the db
        products = data.products // Set the empty object to the products in the db
        return products // Return the products
      }

```

</div>

<br />

## **Nested and Dynamic Routes**

<br />

So, we have our products, but we want to be able to create individual pages for each product so that people can share links to them. Also, we want to be able to share our data loading between these pages to avoid unnecessary server requests. We can do this by using nested and dynamic routes.

<br />

Generally, this would be achieved by sharing the same pathname for all of the pages that you want to share data between. For example, if you wanted to share data between the /products and /products/:id pages, you would use the same pathname for both of them. This is called a nested route. But, this is also a dynamic route in that it uses a wildcard or a specific character like a colon to indicate a dynamic segment of the pathname.

<br />

Most routers employ regex to find this character and then use it to match the pathname to the route. This is a very powerful tool, but it can also be a bit confusing. I made a decision to not use any regex in this project. Instead, I will simply be designating one individual route as the dynamic route and then using the pathname to determine how to render the component. Frankly, I think this is a lot easier to understand and maintain.

<br />

However, this method is very inexact. Despite my best efforts, I could not get the product and products page to share a route. I was able to get it to work for most situations, but I had enough edge cases that I decided to just use two separate routes. This is a bit more verbose, but it is also a lot more explicit and easier to understand. I may come back to this project in the future and try to get it to work with nested routes, but for now, I'm going to move on.

<br />

## **New Router and Routes**

<br />

In our last chapter, our `Routes` configuration object handled all of the rendering logic. Also, our `Router` function was not capable of handling dynamic routes. Let's see one way of changing them after separating our concerns to add this functionality.

<br />

<div
  style={{
    maxWidth: "100%",
    overflow: "auto",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    fontSize: "1.3rem",
  }}
>

  ```js
  const Routes = [
        { path: "/", component: Home },
        { path: "/about", component: About },
        { path: "/products", component: ProductsPage },
        { path: "/product", component: ProductPage },
        { path: "/cart", component: Cart },
      ]

      const Router = (potentialRoute) => {
      const dynamicRoute = "product" // Define a dynamic route
        if (
          // We're turning the path into an array by splitting it every time we see a slash.
          potentialRoute.split("/")[1] === dynamicRoute &&
          // Then we're checking to see if the second item is our dynamic route.
          potentialRoute.split("/")[2]
          // Finally, we're making sure there is an id in the third item.
        ) {
          console.log("Dynamic route detected")
          const id = potentialRoute.split("/")[2]
          // If there is a third item, we're setting it to the id variable.
          return ProductPage(id)
          // Then we're calling the ProductPage function and passing it the id.
        } else {
          console.log("Static route detected")
          const route = Routes.find(
            (route) => route.path === potentialRoute
          )
          route ? route.component() : Nope()
        }
      }

```

</div>

<br />

If you wanted to have multiple dynamic routes, we could define them as an array. Then, we could create a separate part of our Routes object that would hold the processing logic for each dynamic route. I thought about doing this for the project, but I honestly couldn't think of a good use case for it. So, I decided to keep it simple.

<br />

## **Conclusion and Demo**

<br />

So, we have fully working dynamic routes-- even though it could be done in a more elegant way. I'm not particularly happy with my implementation, but it works. We're getting there, but the buttons don't work yet. Let's see it in action.

<br />

## **Other Ways to Do This**

<br />

Like I said, I'm not particularly happy with my implementation. So, if you would like to see some other ways to do it, check out the following links. Some of these served as inspiration for my implementation. However, I didn't like how many of them employed an object-oriented approach or used regex. 

<br />

I'm more of a functional programmer, so I wanted to keep it that way. After completing this tutorial, I think there is definite merit both in the object-oriented approach and using regex for parsing the pathname. So, I can't blame you if you decide to use one of these other approaches. Something like hash routing is generally outdated, but it is still a viable option.
