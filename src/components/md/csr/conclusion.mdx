## **Discussion**

<br />

Well, we've come a long way from hello world. I hope that you've learned some tricks along the way. I've done this code a million different ways at this point, and this final version has prioritized readability above everything. I definitely didn't use the most efficient methods. But, I encourage you to check out some of the other links mentioned in chapter 13 if you still feel the need to flex your routing muscles.

## **Conclusion and Demo**

<br />

While I've been working on this project, I've been thinking about how I could make improve it. I've come up with a few ideas, and the code has been refactored endlessly, but I'm really not sure what's best from here. One way or another, I'm definitely coming back soon for a version 2.0. So, if you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JessePence5) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/8qZ3Z5Z). I'd love to have some help with making this project better.

<br />

The next project will start with moving everything into individual files and folders. I just need to see this code converted into something readable. From there, do I convert it to React? Continue to show the limits of Vanilla JS? I'm not sure. Does anyone care? We'll see.

<iframe
  style="height: fit-content; aspect-ratio: 16/9; width: 100%; border: 2px solid #000; border-radius: 10px; shadow: 0 10px 10px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);"
  src="/products"
  id="demo"

And again, here's the code on github (the comments are slightly different):

<br />

<div
  style={{
    maxWidth: "100%",
    overflow: "auto",
    borderRadius: "5px",
    fontSize: "1.3rem",
  }}
