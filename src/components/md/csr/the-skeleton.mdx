## **Introduction**

<br />

By the end of this chapter, we will have something that almost looks like a real app. It only took us ten chapters! Today, we will build the essential structure of our application, and we will even start to build our theme selection feature so we can see our app's current limitations. Let's get started!

<br />

## **HTML**

Let's start with the HTML. Like I said, the header and the navbar are the only things that will be statically defined in the HTML. The rest will be dynamically generated by our JavaScript. Let's see what this looks like:

<br />

index.html

```html
<!-- Meta Tags, etc. -->
  <body class="dark">
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/" class="Link">Home</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/about" class="Link">About</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/products" class="Link">Products</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/cart" class="Link">Cart </a>
          <span id="cart-count"></span>
          <span id="cart-total"></span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <input aria-label="Search" type="text" placeholder="Search" />
        </li>
        <li>
          <button id="toggleTheme">Toggle Theme</button>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <main class="main"></main>
    <footer>
      <a href="http://jazzypants.dev"> Â© 2023 Jovial Penguin, LLC.</a>
    </footer>
    </body>
    </html>
```

<br />

So, as you can see, if anything has state, it doesn't need to be defined in the HTML. The only initial state that we have defined is the theme being defaulted to 'dark'. While the cart's initial state is always empty, we will be calculating what is in it dynamically so a static value is not needed.

<br />

## **CSS**

As we all know, HTML is not much without CSS. We're going to be keeping it extremely simple here. We're going to be using some hard absolute positioning for the navbar and the footer, and a scrollable flexbox column for the main content. Let's see what this looks like:

<br />

index.HTML

```css
<style>
    body {
      position: absolute; /* only need to do this because of the navbar and footer */
      overflow: hidden; /* since footer is absolute, we will need a scrollbar inside */
      width: 100%; /* take up the entire screen */
      height: 100%; /* ditto */
      margin: 0; /* no margins to avoid void around the edges */
      padding: 0; /* ditto */
      display: flex; /* flexbox */
      flex-direction: column; /* vertical layout */
      justify-content: center; /* center everything */
      align-items: center; /* ditto */
      text-align: center; /* ditto */
    } // this is the container that will hold everything

    .dark {
      background-color: #222; /* dark theme */
      color: #fff; /* white text */
    }
    .dark a {
      color: #88f; /* purple links */
    } // theme 1
    .purple {
      background-color: #88f; /* purple theme */
      color: #ff0; /* yellow text */
    }
    .purple a {
      color: #292; /* green links */
    } // theme 2
    .green {
      background-color: #0f0; /* green theme */
      color: #911; /* red text */
    }
    .green a {
      color: #999; /* gray links */
    } // theme 3

    nav,
    footer {
      width: 100%;
      position: absolute;
      background-color: #222; /* keep nav and footer dark */
    } /* take up whole screen at the top and bottom */

    nav {
      top: 0;
      left: 0;
    } /* starting at top-left */

    ul {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-evenly;
      align-items: center;
      list-style: none;
    } /* make a horizontal list */

    main {
      width: 100%; /* take up the whole screen */
      overflow-y: auto; /* scrollable */
      margin: 2rem auto; /* centered but away from nav and footer */
    }

    img {
      aspect-ratio: 1/1; /* square */
      object-fit: contain; /* scale to fit */
      width: 100%; /* take up the whole area if you can*/
      max-height: 50vh; /* but not too big */
    }

    footer {
      bottom: 0; /* starting at bottom */
    }

  </style>
```

<br />

It's not much, but this is not a design course. We're just trying to get something that looks like an app. If you're building this at home, feel free to add some more CSS to make it look better. This will be it for this tutorial however.

<br />

We start off by turning the entire body of our HTML into a large container that permanently takes up the entire screen. Next, we define a number of themes before absolutely positioning the navbar on the top and the footer on the bottom. Along the way, we just define some basic flexbox properties to make sure everything is centered and spaced evenly. This is all we need for full mobile responsiveness. Try expanding and contracting the window and see what happens!
